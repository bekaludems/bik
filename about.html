 <p style="font-size: 30px;">I was born in the Debrebrhan Zone and my educational journey began in that place the school name is chach.
 where i completed my primary education at chach school up to 8th grade.I moved to Addis Ababa 
 and completed my secondary education from grades 9 to 12 at Lem Secondary School. 
 After taking the national entrance exam, i successfully passed and gained direct admission to university
 and i prefer to attend at WSU and i was fortunate to have that preference granted.
where I am currently a dedicated third-year Computer Science student.
My primary goal is to achieve mastery in key programming languages,
enabling me to develop innovative applications and games.
 Ultimately, I aspire to become a skilled problem-solver in the tech field,
 using my abilities to create meaningful solutions and provide steadfast support for my family.</p>
